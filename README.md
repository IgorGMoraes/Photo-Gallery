# Photo-Gallery
#### A platform for photographers to share their work

Travelers Group is a worldwide organization where professionals and non-professionals photographers and artists (all of whom are called publishers) share their work to the internet, to a website. For each photo and album page, there will be ads of Travelers Group partners being displayed. Those ads are monetized based on the number of visualizations, and a percentage of this revenue will be shared with publishers proportional to the visualization of their materials.
